I'm so happy to announce the release of [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) 3.2.0.
taylor provides data on Taylor Swift's discography, including lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and song characteristics from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

You can install the updated version from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("taylor")
```

This is a minor release to update the package following the end of The Eras Tour.
This blog post will highlight the changes in this release.

```{r}
library(taylor)
```

## It's the end of an Era...

The primary update completion of the `eras_tour_surprise` data to include surprise songs from the European and final North American legs of The Eras Tour.
You can now find all surprise songs in [`eras_tour_surprise`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::eras_tour_surprise")`).

```{r}
#| label: surprise-song-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

eras_tour_surprise %>% 
  filter(leg == "Europe")

eras_tour_surprise %>% 
  filter(leg == "North America (Leg 2)")
```

Using this data, we can, for example, look at the cumulative number of songs Taylor performed from each album over the course of the tour.

```{r}
#| label: eras-plot
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Plot code"
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 1.1
#| out-width: "90%"
#| fig-alt: >
#|   A horizontal bar graph showing track names on the y-axis and song energey
#|   on the x-axis. Bars a filled with colors derived from the TTPD color
#|   palette, ranging from a light grey to black.

leg_labels <- unique(eras_tour_surprise$leg)
leg_labels <- gsub("South America", "South\nAmerica", leg_labels)

surprise_song_count <- eras_tour_surprise %>%
  nest(dat = -c(leg, date, city, night)) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(leg = factor(leg, levels = unique(eras_tour_surprise$leg),
                      labels = leg_labels)) %>%
  mutate(show_number = seq_len(n()), .after = night) %>%
  unnest(dat) %>%
  left_join(distinct(taylor_album_songs, track_name, album_name),
            join_by(song == track_name),
            relationship = "many-to-one") %>%
  count(leg, date, city, night, show_number, album_name) %>%
  complete(nesting(leg, date, city, night, show_number), album_name) %>%
  mutate(n = replace_na(n, 0)) %>%
  arrange(album_name, date, night) %>%
  mutate(surprise_count = cumsum(n), .by = album_name) %>%
  left_join(select(taylor_albums, album_name, album_release),
            by = "album_name") %>%
  mutate(surprise_count = case_when(
    album_name == "THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT" &
      date < album_release ~ NA_integer_,
    .default = surprise_count
  )) %>%
  add_row(leg = factor("Europe"), album_name = "THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT",
          show_number = 83.5, surprise_count = 0L) %>%
  mutate(album_name = replace_na(album_name, "Other"),
         album_group = album_name,
         album_name = factor(album_name, c(album_levels, "Other"),
                             labels = c(gsub("POETS DEPARTMENT",
                                             "POETS<br>DEPARTMENT",
                                             album_levels), "Other")))

ggplot(surprise_song_count) +
  facet_wrap(~ album_name, ncol = 3, axes = "all_x") +
  geom_line(data = ~select(.x, -album_name),
            aes(x = show_number, y = surprise_count, group = album_group),
            color = "grey80", na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_line(aes(x = show_number, y = surprise_count, color = album_group),
            show.legend = FALSE, linewidth = 2, na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_color_albums(na.value = "grey80") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, seq(30, 200, 30))) +
  labs(x = "Show", y = "Songs Played")
```

Finally, also inspired by some of Taylor's surprise song choices, [`taylor_all_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`) has been updated to include songs Taylor wrote, but is not the performer (e.g., "This is What You Came For" by Calvin Harris, featuring Rihanna).

```{r}
taylor_all_songs |> 
  filter(!str_detect(artist, "Taylor Swift"),
         is.na(featuring) | !str_detect(featuring, "Taylor Swift"))
```


## Minor Changes

There were also a couple of minor improvements:

* Error messages and color palette displays have been improved thanks to [@olivroy](https://github.com/wjakethompson/taylor/pull/49)
* Spotify data for "Half Of My Heart" has been removed, as the version featuring Taylor Swift is no longer available.

For a complete list of changes, check out the [changelog](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/news/index.html#taylor-320).
