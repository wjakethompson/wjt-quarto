I'm remarkably excited to announce the release of [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) 3.1.0.
taylor provides data on Taylor Swift's discography, including lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and song characteristics from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

You can install the updated version from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("taylor")
```

This blog post will highlight the major changes in this release, including the addition of data from *THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT*.

```{r}
library(taylor)
```

## Who uses typewriters, anyway?

The primary update is the addition of data from *THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT (TTPD)*.
You can now find Spotify data and lyrics for all 31 songs in [`taylor_all_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`).

```{r}
#| label: ttpd-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

taylor_all_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT")
```

*TTPD* has also been added to [`taylor_albums`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_albums")`).
However, Metacritic is currently undergoing some updates, and therefore user scores are currently disabled for albums.
Thus, only the critic composite score is available for *1989 (Taylor's Version)* and *TTPD*.

```{r}
#| label: ttpd-albums
taylor_albums
```

Finally, a new color palette inspired by the *TTPD* aesthetic has been added to the [`album_palettes`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::album_palettes")`), and the [package website](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) has been updated with a new theme and logo, also inspired by the album cover.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ttpd-palette
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-asp: 1
#| fig-alt: >
#|   The five colors of the TTPD color palette. The hexadecimal codes are
#|   #1C160F, #3F3824, #635B3A, #ADA795, and #F7F4F0

scales::show_col(unname(album_palettes$tortured_poets))
```

This palette can be used inside any of the [`scale_*_taylor_*()`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::scale_color_taylor_d()")`) functions.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ttpd-energy
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-asp: 1
#| fig-alt: >
#|   A horizontal bar graph showing track names on the y-axis and song energey
#|   on the x-axis. Bars a filled with colors derived from the TTPD color
#|   palette, ranging from a light grey to black.

taylor_album_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT", !is.na(energy)) %>% 
  mutate(track_name = fct_inorder(track_name)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = energy, y = fct_rev(track_name))) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = track_name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_taylor_d(album = "THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT") +
  labs(x = "Song Energy (From Spotify)", y = NULL)
```

## Minor Changes

There were also a number of minor improvements:

* Additional documentation has been added to better describe how to access lyrics in [`taylor_all_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`) and [`taylor_album_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_album_songs")`) (see [`vignette("lyrics")`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/articles/lyrics)).
* Spotify audio features for "You're Losing Me (From The Vault)" have been added to [`taylor_all_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`) and [`taylor_album_songs`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::taylor_album_songs")`).
* Surprise songs data for the South American and Asia-Pacific legs of The Eras Tour have been added to [`eras_tour_surprise`](`r downlit::autolink_url("taylor::eras_tour_surprise")`).
