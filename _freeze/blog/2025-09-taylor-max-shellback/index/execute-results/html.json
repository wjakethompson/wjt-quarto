Remove duplicate songs, keeping the original versions.\n2. Add indicator for previous Max Martin and Shellback collaborations.\n\nAnd now we can compare!\nThe plot below shows the middle 97%, 89%, and 67% of songs on valence, energy, and danceability for each collaborator group.\nTaylor's previous collaborations with Max and Shellback tend to have higher danceability, energy, and valence than her other songs.\nThis definitely matches my own experience with these songs, and the reputation (pun intended) of these songs as Taylor's pop-iest songs.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(ggdist)\nlibrary(ggpattern)\n#> Warning: package 'ggpattern' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\nrect_height <- .8\nrect_pad <- 0.3\n\ntms |> \n  group_by(max_shellback, metric) |> \n  median_qi(\n    .width = c(.67, .89, .97),\n    .exclude = c(\"album_name\", \"track_name\")\n  ) |> \n  mutate(.width = factor(.width)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = value,\n    y = fct_rev(factor(metric)),\n    width = .upper - .lower\n  )) +\n  geom_tile(\n    data = tibble(\n      value = c(.63, .60, .69, .54, .45, .35),\n      metric = rep(c(\"danceability\", \"energy\", \"valence\"), each = 2),\n      max_shellback = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), times = 3),\n      .width = rep(c(\"0.67\", \"0.89\", \"0.97\"), each = 2)\n    ),\n    aes(group = max_shellback, alpha = .width),\n    height = rect_height,\n    width = 0.01,\n    fill = \"grey20\",\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  geom_tile_pattern(\n    data = ~filter(.x, .width == \"0.97\"),\n    aes(pattern_filename = max_shellback,),\n    pattern = \"image\",\n    pattern_type = \"tile\",\n    pattern_scale = .5,\n    height = rect_height,\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  geom_tile(\n    data = ~filter(.x, .width == \"0.97\"), \n    aes(group = max_shellback),\n    height = rect_height,\n    fill = \"white\",\n    alpha = 0.7,\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  geom_tile_pattern(\n    data = ~filter(.x, .width == \"0.89\"),\n    aes(pattern_filename = max_shellback,),\n    pattern = \"image\",\n    pattern_type = \"tile\",\n    pattern_scale = .5,\n    height = rect_height,\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  geom_tile(\n    data = ~filter(.x, .width == \"0.89\"),\n    aes(group = max_shellback),\n    height = rect_height,\n    fill = \"white\",\n    alpha = 0.4,\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  geom_tile_pattern(\n    data = ~filter(.x, .width == \"0.67\"),\n    aes(pattern_filename = max_shellback,),\n    pattern = \"image\",\n    pattern_type = \"tile\",\n    pattern_scale = .5,\n    height = rect_height,\n    position = position_dodge2(padding = rect_pad)\n  ) +\n  expand_limits(x = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = str_to_title) +\n  scale_pattern_filename_discrete(\n    choices = c(\"glitter/glitter-orange.png\", \"glitter/glitter-green.png\"),\n    breaks = c(\"TRUE\", \"FALSE\"),\n    labels = c(\"Max Martin & Shellback\", \"Solo and Other Collaborators\"),\n    name = \"Collaborator\"\n  ) +\n  scale_alpha_manual(\n    values = c(\"0.67\" = 1, \"0.89\" = 0.6, \"0.97\" = 0.3),\n    limits = c(\"0.97\", \"0.89\", \"0.67\"),\n    labels = c(\"97%\", \"89%\", \"67%\"),\n    drop = FALSE,\n    name = \"Interval\"\n  ) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, pattern_filename = NULL) +\n  theme(legend.box = \"vertical\") +\n  guides(\n    pattern_filename = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(pattern_type = \"expand\")\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/collab-compare-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs someone who loves glitter-pen Taylor Swift songs, I can't wait for the new album!\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nFeatured photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dagmara_rune?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Summer Rune</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-group-of-different-colored-nail-polishes-h8oHBwv34yI?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>.\n      \n",
