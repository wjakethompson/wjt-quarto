The PIE project team will design, develop, and evaluate a prototype integrated assessment model that provides multiple measures of student progress and achievement using instructionally embedded and end-of-year assessments that are aligned to research-based cognitive models of learning.\n>\n> PIE is a four-year grant-funded project led by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) in partnership with ATLAS.\n",
