(2010)](https://jonathantemplin.com/diagnostic-measurement-theory-methods-applications/), [Bradshaw (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118956588.ch13), and [de la Torre and Sorrel (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108902724.010).\nmeasr automatically generates the Stan code necessary for a variety of diagnostic models, estimates the model, and provides functionality to evaluate the model's performance using model fit indices, information criteria, and reliability metrics.\n\n",
