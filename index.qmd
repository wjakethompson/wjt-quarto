I'm the assistant director of psychometrics at [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems (ATLAS)](https://atlas.ku.edu), a strategic center within the [Achievement and Assessment Institute](https://aai.ku.edu) at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu).
I received a PhD in educational psychology and research from the University of Kansas' [School of Education and Human Sciences](https://soehs.ku.edu/) in 2018.

I am the lead psychometrician for the [Dynamic Learning Maps&reg;](https://www.dynamiclearningmaps.org) alternate assessments, which are administered annually to students with significant cognitive disabilities from grades 3--12 in 22 states.
I have also led the psychometric work innovative assessment projects such as the [Innovations in Science Map, Assessment and Report Technologies (I-SMART)](https://www.ismart.works/) and [Pathways for Instructionally Embedded Assessment (PIE)](https://pie.atlas4learning.org/).
In all of these assessments, I am primarily focused on the application of diagnostic psychometric models to improve instructional decision-making and student learning.

My research interests also include Bayesian modeling, data visualization, and R programming.
I am the author of several [R](https://www.r-project.org) packages including [measr](https://www.measr.info) for estimating and evaluating diagnostic classification models and [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) for accessing lyrics and audio data for [Taylor Swift's](https://www.taylorswift.com/) discography.
I also regularly lead workshops on how to use R and [Stan](https://www.mc-stan.org) for [applying diagnostic classification models](https://stancon2023.measr.info) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) for [data science](https://tidyds-2021.wjakethompson.com/).
