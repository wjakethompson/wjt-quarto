## Diagnostic Psychometrics with R and Stan

This half-day workshop provides an introduction to diagnostic classification models for applied research.
Participants learn what diagnostic models are, when they are useful, and how which research questions they can answer.
We then use the [measr](https://measr.info) package to estimate different types of diagnostic models and evaluate model performance.

This workshop has previously been presented at:

* StanCon 2023, Washington University in St. Louis
* NCME 2024, Philadelphia, PA

See the workshop websites for more, including links to the GitHub repositories for all workshop materials.
