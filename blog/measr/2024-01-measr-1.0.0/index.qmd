I am thrilled to announce the release of [measr](https://measr.info) 1.0.0.
The goal of measr is to provide a user-friendly interface for estimating and evaluating diagnostic classification models (DCMs; also called cognitive diagnostic models [CDMs]).
This is a major release to mark the conclusion of the initial development work that was funded by the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov).
Importantly, this does not mean that measr is going dormant!
We are still actively developing measr, so we'll continue to [add new features and respond to bug reports](https://github.com/wjakethompson/measr/issues).

You can install the updated version of measr from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("measr")
```

This blog post will highlight...

```{r}
library(measr)
```
