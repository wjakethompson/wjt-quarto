also called cognitive diagnostic models [CDMs]).\nThis is a major release to mark the conclusion of the initial development work that was funded by the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov).\nImportantly, this does not mean that measr is going dormant!\nWe are still actively developing measr, so we'll continue to [add new features and respond to bug reports](https://github.com/wjakethompson/measr/issues).\n\nYou can install the updated version of measr from CRAN with:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"measr\")\n```\n\nThis blog post will highlight the major improvements, including improved documentation and vignettes, as well as a some minor updates.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(measr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Improved Documentation\n\nThe focus of recent work on measr has been to improve documentation.\nTo that end, the existing vignettes have been updated, and several new vignettes have been added.\n\nFirst, the [getting started](https://measr.info/articles/measr) vignette has been updated to include additional installation information.\nThis should help reduce the friction for setting up the components needed for measr, namely, installing [*Stan*](https://mc-stan.org).\nBecause measr interfaces with *Stan* to estimate DCMs, a working *Stan* installation is needed for the package to function properly.\nThe updated vignette includes helpful guidance for installing both the [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan) and [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr) packages for using *Stan*.\nOnly one of the two is required, but both are supported so you can choose whichever *Stan* front end you prefer.\n\nA new vignette on [model evaluation](https://measr.info/articles/model-evaluation) has been added to demonstrate different methods for assessing the performance of a DCM after it has been estimated.\nThis includes the *M<sub>2</sub>* statistic [@liu2016], as well as posterior predictive model checks for evaluating both overall and item-level model fit [@sinharay2007; @thompson2019].\nTo demonstrate how these methods are implemented for measr, a simulated data set is used where we know how well different types of DCMs should fit.\nThe existing [model estimation](https://measr.info/articles/model-estimation) vignette was also updated to use this same simulated data set so that we can compare parameter estimates derived from measr to the known parameter values that were used to generate the data.\n\nBecause the model estimation and evaluation vignettes now use simulated data, we also added a [case study](https://measr.info/articles/ecpe) to walk through a DCM-based analysis from start to finish using a real data set.\nIn this case study, data from the *Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English* (ECPE), which has been widely used in the DCM literature [e.g., @templin-emip-2013].\nWe start with exploratory analyses, then we estimate a DCM, examine parameter estimates, and interpret model fit and reliability analyses. \n\nFinally, example uses have been added for all functions included in measr.\nThese examples can be found on the documentation pages for each function.\nAll functions are indexed on the [reference page](https://measr.info/reference/), which has been reorganized to group functions with related functionality.\n\n## Minor Changes\n\nThere were also a number of minor improvements:\n\n* The Stan code for estimating models has been updated to be compatible with the new array syntax.\n* We published an article on measr in the *Journal of Open Source Software* [@thompson-joss-2023], and the [preferred citation](https://measr.info/authors#citation) when using measr has been updated.\n\nFor a complete list of changes, check out the [changelog](https://measr.info/news/index.html#measr-100).\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nIf you are interested in learing more about measr and diagnostic models, I taught a workshop in June at [StanCon 2023](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2023/).\nThe workshop provided an overview of diagnostic models and their use cases and then walked through how to estimate and evaluate different models using measr.\nAll of the [workshop materials](https://stancon2023.measr.info/) are available online, including slides, exercises, and solutions.\n\nFinally, if you are interested in attending a workshop in person, I'll be teaching another workshop in April at the 2024 annual meeting of the National Conference on Measurement in Education (NCME).\nFor more information on the conference and register, see the [conference website](https://www.ncme.org/event/annual-meeting/upcoming-meeting2024).\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nThe research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant [R305D210045](https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=4546) to the University of Kansas.
